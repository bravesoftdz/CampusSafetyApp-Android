# safety-application
Safety application for our campus

NetworkDef.java file
- Should supply own email to test if it works.

The only folder you should need is the src folder. which is what is downloaded when you pull. It makes it easy for our team to deal
with other source code being modified.

You will need to create a new project.
The name of the project should be: CampusSafety
The name of the "Company" or package name should be: csusb

Our app targets Android API 14 and up to 19 though it may work on higher versions (those versions are not tested).

When the project is created you will travel through the project to

root_project_folder -> app

You should see the src folder

You will copy the downloaded/pulled src folder from the github over the src folder in the Project.

That's it. We used no fancy things from the different versions of the Android SDK so it should recognize everything fine.
It may show redlines or may not recognize everything so you may need to try and run the app to force it to fix itself or recognize
all files.

Everything should work as expected.
